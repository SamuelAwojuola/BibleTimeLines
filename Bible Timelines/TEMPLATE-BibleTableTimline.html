                    <p>The flood destroyed Eden and its Garden which was the Tabernacle of God before it. Though God still related with men, as is evident with Melchizedek, Abraham, even all the way to Balaam, there was temple on earth until the institution of the Old Covenant in the wilderness.<br>
                        Nevertheless, though there wasn't a temple until the Law, there were altars. Noah built one after the flood, and Abraham also did.</p>
